# OIBSIP - OASIS INFOBYTE INTERN PROGRAM - LEVEL1
<h3 align="left">OASIS INFOBYTE provides different services for making websites. I got an opportunity for a 1-month internship in web development and design. They gave me 3 tasks to do. If I do them well and everything looks good, I'll get a certificate. I'm happy to be in the OASIS INFOBYTE intern program.</h3>
